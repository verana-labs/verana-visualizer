# Task ID: 3
# Title: Scale Node Sizes Based on Deposit Amounts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement proportional node sizing in the 3D graph based on deposit amounts - larger deposits should have bigger nodes
# Details:
Create a visual relationship between deposit amounts and node sizes in the 3D network graph. This will help users visually identify nodes with larger deposits.

# Test Strategy:
Verify nodes with larger deposits appear larger. Test with various deposit amounts to ensure proper scaling.
