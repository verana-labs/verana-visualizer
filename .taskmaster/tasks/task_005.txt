# Task ID: 5
# Title: Add Particle Animations to Graph Links
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement particle animations on links in the 3D graph with light effects and blur, similar to real-time transactions. Should be subtle and periodic, not always on all nodes
# Details:
Add subtle particle animations that move along the links between nodes. The animation should be periodic and not persistent on all links at once, creating a dynamic and visually appealing network visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify particle animations appear periodically on links. Ensure performance is not significantly impacted. Test the subtlety of the effect.
